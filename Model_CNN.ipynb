       "\"Trump's legal team spokesman resigns amid reported shake-upWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s outside legal team spokesman has resigned amid media reports the team is being reorganized as investigations continue into alleged Russian meddling in the U.S. election and possible collusion with Trump’s campaign.  Mark Corallo confirmed his departure on Friday in an emailed statement. His resignation comes amid reports regarding the role of Marc Kasowitz, Trump’s attorney handing the investigation into the Trump campaign’s possible ties to Russia.  NBC reported on Friday that Kasowitz was no longer leading the legal team but would remain on board to provide guidance. The New York Times reported late on Thursday that his “role ... will be significantly reduced.” A source familiar with the situation told Reuters on Friday that Kasowitz had not left the team. Separately, Trump is considering appointing Wall Street financier and long-time supporter Anthony Scaramucci as his White House communications director, according to a senior White House official. The staff changes come amid other media reports that some of Trump’s lawyers are considering ways to limit U.S. special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe.  The Washington Post, citing people familiar with the effort, reported late Thursday that Trump’s legal team is seeking to limit or undercut the investigation by targeting Mueller’s team and is exploring Trump’s pardoning authority.  The New York Times also reported that Trump’s lawyers are looking into the background of Mueller’s investigators, citing three people familiar with the research effort. Moscow has denied any interference with last year’s U.S. presidential election. Trump has also said there was no collusion.  \""

       "'aid group warns of death among rohingya in bangladeshcox s bazar  bangladesh  reuters    rohingya refugees in bangladesh could die due to a lack of  food  shelter and water  given the huge numbers fleeing violence in myanmar  an aid agency warned on sunday  as authorities began moving people to camps to streamline the distribution of help  nearly 410 000 members of the rohingya muslim minority fled from myanmar s western rakhine state to bangladesh to escape a military offensive that the united nations has branded a  textbook example of ethnic cleansing    many people are arriving hungry  exhausted and with no food or water   mark pierce  bangladesh country director for the save the children aid agency said in a statement   i m particularly worried that the demand for food  shelter  water and basic hygiene support is not being met due to the sheer number of people in need  if families can t meet their basic needs  the suffering will get even worse and lives could be lost   bangladesh has for decades faced influxes of rohingya fleeing persecution in buddhist majority myanmar  where the rohingya are regarded as illegal migrants  bangladesh was already home to 400 000 rohingya before the latest crisis erupted on aug  25  when rohingya insurgents attacked police posts and an army camp in the western state of rakhine  killing a dozen people  pierce said the humanitarian response needed to be rapidly scaled up   that can only be done if the international community steps up funding   he said  rights monitors and fleeing rohingya say myanmar security forces and rakhine buddhist vigilantes responded to the aug  25 insurgent attacks with what they say is a campaign of violence and arson aimed at driving out the muslim population  myanmar rejects that  saying its security forces are carrying out clearance operations against the insurgents of the arakan rohingya salvation army  which claimed responsibility for the august attacks and similar  smaller  raids in october  the myanmar government has declared the group a terrorist organization and accused it of setting the fires and attacking civilians  bangladesh border guards said the flow of refugees leaving myanmar had eased off over the past day  apparently because bad weather had discouraged people from taking to boats to reach bangladesh   heavy rain has turned roads into mud  with refugees huddling under shelters of bamboo and plastic sheets beside them  bangladeshi authorities said they had started moving an estimated 100 000 rohingya living by the roads to camps designated as aid points   we re not allowing any distribution to anyone from the side of the road   said district government official kazi abdur rahman   we want to convince them there s everything in the camp and nothing here   a big new camp is planned but it is unclear how long it would take to build   people are living in these muddy  awful conditions  you have to get them to some sort of space where aid can be delivered   said chris lom of the international organization for migration    clean water and sanitation can only be delivered in a structured environment   there is no sign that violence has stopped in myanmar  with smoke  apparently from burning villages  seen as recently as friday  meaning more refugees are likely to cross  human rights watch said satellite imagery showed 62 rohingya villages had been torched since the violence erupted  myanmar says more than 430 people have been killed  most of them insurgents  and about 30 000 non muslim villagers have been displaced   myanmar government leader and nobel laureate aung san suu kyi has faced a barrage of criticism from abroad for not stopping the violence  the military remains in full control of security policy and there is little sympathy for the rohingya in a country where the end of army rule has unleashed old animosities  and the military campaign in rakhine state is widely supported  suu kyi is due to make her first address to the nation on the crisis on tuesday  her foreign supporters and western governments that backed her campaign against military rule  and see her as the best hope for myanmar s future  will be hoping to see her make a commitment to protect the rights of the muslim minority  suu kyi s supporters at home could be disappointed if she is perceived to be caving in to foreign pressure and taking the side of a muslim minority blamed for initiating the violence  the united states has called for the protection of civilians and a deputy assistant secretary of state  patrick murphy  is due in myanmar this week  he will travel to sittwe  the capital of rakhine state  to meet government officials and representatives of different communities  including rohingya  but he is not seeking to travel to the conflict zone in northern rakhine state  the military has called for unity on the issue  the political party founded by retired officers and trounced by suu kyi s party in the 2015 election  could be expected to take heart to see her support eroded by the crisis'"

      "Trump's legal team spokesman resigns amid reported shake-upWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s outside legal team spokesman has resigned amid media reports the team is being reorganized as investigations continue into alleged Russian meddling in the U.S. election and possible collusion with Trump’s campaign.  Mark Corallo confirmed his departure on Friday in an emailed statement. His resignation comes amid reports regarding the role of Marc Kasowitz, Trump’s attorney handing the investigation into the Trump campaign’s possible ties to Russia.  NBC reported on Friday that Kasowitz was no longer leading the legal team but would remain on board to provide guidance. The New York Times reported late on Thursday that his “role ... will be significantly reduced.” A source familiar with the situation told Reuters on Friday that Kasowitz had not left the team. Separately, Trump is considering appointing Wall Street financier and long-time supporter Anthony Scaramucci as his White House communications director, according to a senior White House official. The staff changes come amid other media reports that some of Trump’s lawyers are considering ways to limit U.S. special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe.  The Washington Post, citing people familiar with the effort, reported late Thursday that Trump’s legal team is seeking to limit or undercut the investigation by targeting Mueller’s team and is exploring Trump’s pardoning authority.  The New York Times also reported that Trump’s lawyers are looking into the background of Mueller’s investigators, citing three people familiar with the research effort. Moscow has denied any interference with last year’s U.S. presidential election. Trump has also said there was no collusion. \n"
